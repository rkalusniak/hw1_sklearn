# Project hw1_sklearn notes

 
This project is the assignment for my Advanced Analytics with Python (MIS 6900) class in Summer 2023

# Data sources
This project uses the Kansas City housing data.

# Data prep
The project provided a preprocessing data file to create a binary target variable. The target variable 'price_gt_1M' is 1 if
the price is greater than or equal to $1 million and zero otherwise. The processed data is broken into two data sources.
* kc_house_data_classification.csv
* kc_house_data_regression.csv

# Deliverables
This project includes a Jupyter notebook, showcasing the code and implcations of the model. There also is a .dot and .png file showcasing the decision tree model.
